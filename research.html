                </ul>
                <p>His research has garnered over 5,902 citations with an H-index of 42, i10-index of 112 (14th Feb 2025), and he continues to push academic boundaries with his students' work gaining significant recognition, including recent acceptance for drone testing at the ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE’25), the first industry-scale extensive study on autonomous driving testing at the ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE’22), and multiple best paper awards, including the recent best paper award at the 21st IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS).</p>
                <p>A/Prof. Zheng's leadership extends to serving as multiple TPC and General Chairs for ACM/IEEE/Springer/CCF conferences. He has also served on the Program Committees for leading conferences, such as ICSE (2026), CAV (2025), FSE (2022, 2024) and PerCom (2017-2025). He is an associate editor for ACM Distributed Ledger Technologies and an editor for Springer’s Journal of Reliable Intelligent Environments.</p>
                <p>In 2023, A/Prof. Zheng served as a visiting professor at both UCLA and UT Austin, and he co-founded the International Workshop on Trustworthy Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (TACPS.org), further contributing to his reputation as a global leader in the field. His numerous recognitions include the Deakin Industry Researcher Award (2016) and the MQ Early Career Researcher Award (Runner-up, 2020). A/Prof. Zheng is a leading co-organizer for the Shonan Meeting (Seminar No. 235) on “LLM-Guided Synthesis, Verification, and Testing of Learning-Enabled CPS” in March 2026 and the Dagstuhl Seminar (202501048) on “Advancing Testability and Verifiability of CPS with Neurosymbolic and Large Language Models” in October 2026.</p>
