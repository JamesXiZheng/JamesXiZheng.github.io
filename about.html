                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>A/Prof. Xi Zheng is a distinguished leader in cyber-physical systems and AI trustworthiness, with substantial achievements in research, funding, and academic leadership. In 2024, he was awarded the prestigious $960,412 ARC Future Fellowship for “Advancing Robust Autonomy in Cyber-Physical Systems,” making him the only recipient in Software Engineering and one of seven in IT across Australia. This marks the first Future Fellowship in the history of Macquarie University's School of Computing.</p>
                <p>A/Prof. Zheng has successfully secured over $2.4 million in competitive funding from the Australian Research Council (including 1 Future Fellowship, 2 Linkages, and 1 Discovery project) and Data61, with a focus on safety analysis, model testing, verification, and trustworthy AI for autonomous vehicles. He is currently leading a $537,041 ARC LP initiative on autonomous path planning for passenger aircraft in collaboration with MIT-based startup Savion and is also a Chief Investigator on major initiatives, such as a $35 million ARC Centre of Excellence bid and a $2.9 million project focused on enhancing rural driving safety.</p>
